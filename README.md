# 2022 Advent of Code

This is my repository for 2022's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event. For each of the first 25 days of december, a new coding challenge is revealed, increasing in difficulty as the month goes on. This site is great for honing programming skills, as well as just providing a fun challenge!

A few years ago I used Advent of Code to learn the language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but this year I'll be completing each challenge using C++, as I haven't had much opportunity to use the language recently.

Because I was out of town visiting relatives for the first week of December this year, I'll be somewhat behind on the challenges, but I'm hoping to catch up before day 25!
